# Starterkit (React, Webpack, Typestyles, Typescript)

## Commands:
  * `yarn`: Install all packages
  * `yarn reinstall`: Remove all files in `node_modules` and reinstall them afterwards
  * `yarn start`: Start a development environment, outputting your application  on `[::]:3000`.
  * `yarn build`: Build a production package and output it in `dist/`

## Usage: 
Just edit the files in `./src/` and get working. I reccomend you read through what's in `package.json` first and try to understand the file structure I went with.
